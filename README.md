This project is based in a small shope website api with some functionllty.
In this project i am going to include a login and authfunction with jwt.
This project is my first project with auth and login so i think this project will take some time. 
And also i am creating this project like the same as real development project i know the folder structre becuse i worked in a real  project for 1 month, so my focus is to devlop the project is in the same way.


Steps
1st  created a folder name as tilu
2nd  initalise the package.json file
3rd  initalise the tscconfig.json file
4th  setup the start script to nodemon index.ts
5th created env.ts ,.env.dev, and database, config file to create enverment varibale
6th created index.ts to start server and connect to database 
7th i added the alias file to setup the path to easy access to files

Note = right now facing some problame in seting env for database
